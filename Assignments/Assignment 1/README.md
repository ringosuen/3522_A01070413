# Pokemon Tamagotchi Simulator

# About 
A simple Tamagotchi Simulator that allows a user to hatch a new Pokemon and interact with it. 

# How To Use 
Once you press run, the game will automatically start hatching an egg for you. 

You will see what's hatched and a menu will appear allowing you to select an action. 

Once the status is checked, the time elapsed is used to update a Pokemon's stats accordingly. 

Food is fed at random. If the random food fed is the Pokemon's favorite food, then a bonus is dedeucted from the hunger status. 

You can keep feeding a Pokemon food until it's no longer hungry. 

You can keep feeding a Pokemon potions until it's health is full. 

You can keep playing with a Pokemon until it's happiness is full. 

When the health hits 0, the game will automatically hatch a new egg for you. 

## Each Pokemon has different personalities:

- Snorlax: Health decreases slowly, but he gets hungry real fast! 
- Charizard: Hard to please this one, his happiness decreases quickly, but hunger level rises slowly. 
- Dragonite: A balanced beauty. Nothing out of the ordinary.

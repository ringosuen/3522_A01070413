# Garment Factory

Question 1: 
We would need to make another Factory. This time a GoosieFactory that extends from the BrandFactory. The Goosie Facotry 
  would have the same three methods: create_shirt_men(), create_shirt_women(), create_socks_unisex(). We would then make 3 new classes
  that make Goosie branded men's shirt, women's shirt and unisex socks. These three classes would be called GoosieMenShirt extending
  ShirtMen, GoosieWomenShirt extending ShirtWomen, and GoosieSockspairUnisex extending SocksPairUnisex. 
  
Question 2: 
For each factory we would make a new additional method called create_activewear_women(). We then would add a new interface called
ActivewearWomen that has the attributes style, size, textile and colour. We would then make a LululimeActivewearWomen class that extends ActivewearWomen, a PineappleRepublicActivewearWomen class extending ActivewearWomen and a NikaActivewearWomen class extending ActiveWomen. 
These 3 classes would make the corresponding Women's Activewear based on the brand.
